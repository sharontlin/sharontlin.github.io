I'm a third-year [electrical engineering and computer science](https://www.eecs.mit.edu/) student at the [Massachusetts Institute of Technology](http://web.mit.edu/). 

I went to [Stuyvesant High School](https://stuy.enschool.org/) where I co-founded [StuyHacks](https://www.facebook.com/stuyhacks/) and worked as a [Major League Hacking](https://mlh.io/) Coach. 

I've worked in a variety of software and security engineering roles at [Cisco Meraki](https://meraki.cisco.com/), [Trail of Bits](https://www.trailofbits.com/), [Tulip Interfaces](https://tulip.co/), and [R2C](https://r2c.dev/). I'll soon be joining [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/) as a software engineering intern. Aside from coding, I also write for [Hackaday](https://hackaday.com/author/sharonlin/) and [Hacker Noon](https://medium.com/hackernoon/fpgas-socs-microcontrollers-a-quick-rundown-of-iot-devices-c5a25c7290c6).

I enjoy [reading](https://reading.supply/post/6ad6051a-e6cb-4a2a-9cf1-101f1d9c0b20), glitch aesthetics, artisanal breadmaking, and exploring the mountains. Let me know if you'd like to go on an adventure! üöê
