I'm a third-year [electrical engineering and computer science](https://www.eecs.mit.edu/) student at the [Massachusetts Institute of Technology](http://web.mit.edu/). 

I'm originally from New Jersey, but I moved to New York where I went to [Stuyvesant High School](https://stuy.enschool.org/) and co-founded [StuyHacks](https://www.facebook.com/stuyhacks/). 

I've worked in a variety of software and security engineering roles at [Cisco Meraki](https://meraki.cisco.com/), [Trail of Bits](https://www.trailofbits.com/), [Tulip Interfaces](https://tulip.co/), [Lincoln Laboratory](https://www.ll.mit.edu/), [MIT Media Lab](https://www.media.mit.edu/), [Major League Hacking](https://mlh.io/), and [Codeacademy](https://www.codecademy.com/). I'll soon be joining [R2C](https://r2c.dev/) and [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/) as a software engineering intern.

Apart from coding, I'm a contributing writer for [Hackaday](https://hackaday.com/author/sharonlin/). I've also written for [Hacker Noon](https://medium.com/hackernoon/fpgas-socs-microcontrollers-a-quick-rundown-of-iot-devices-c5a25c7290c6), [HackerBay](https://blog.hackerbay.io/on-making-choices-c387c9d7ac05), [Huffington Post](https://www.huffpost.com/author/sharon-lin), and [Medium](https://medium.com/@sharonlin).

I love [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/15595124.Sharon_T_Lin), animation, data storytelling, and being outdoors. Let me know if you'd like to go on an adventure! üöê
