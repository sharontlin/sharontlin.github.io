    I'm <b>Sharon Lin</b>, a writer and computer scientist. I grew up surrounded by the sandy shores of Central New Jersey before pursuing my city dreams in Queens, NY.  
<br><br>
    I'm currently interning with Microsoft. Previously, I was at <a href="https://returntocorp.com/">r2c</a>, <a href="https://meraki.cisco.com/">Cisco Meraki</a>, Lincoln Laboratory, <a href="https://www.trailofbits.com/">Trail of Bits</a>, and <a href="https://tulip.co/">Tulip</a>.  
<br><br>
    I'm in my third year at MIT, where I study electrical engineering and computer science and TA for the MIT Entrepreneurship and FinTech Integrator (MEFTI). 
    <br><br>
    I enjoy traveling and writing on the side. I spent a semester abroad in London, photographing my way across continental Europe, and a month in Southeast Asia. I was previously a Major League Hacking Coach, where I traveled across North America empowering student organizers and hackers. 
    <br><br>    
    I write about open-source hardware for <a href="hackaday.com/">Hackaday</a> and software engineering for <a href="https://hackernoon.com/">Hacker Noon</a>. I've also been involved with: 
    <ul>
      <li>WISP: nonprofit for women in security and privacy</li>
      <li>StuyHacks: a hackathon at Stuyvesant High School</li>
    </ul>
