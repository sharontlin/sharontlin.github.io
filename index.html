    I'm <b class="t-hackcss-pop" style="color:#ff2e88;border-bottom:1px solid #ff2e88;">Sharon Lin</b>, a software engineer and writer. I'm finishing my bachelors in electrical engineering and computer science at MIT.  
<br><br>
    I've previously worked on time series analysis at <a href="https://microsoft.com/">Microsoft</a>, static analysis at <a href="https://returntocorp.com/">r2c</a>, and performance engineering at <a href="https://meraki.cisco.com/">Cisco Meraki</a>.   
    <br><br>
    Aside from software, I've also backpacked across Europe and Southeast Asia and worked as a <a href="https://mlh.io/">Major League Hacking</a> Coach, where I helped out hackathon organizers across North America. My current interests include Asian indie rock, pixel art, flash fiction, and <a href="https://skribbl.io/">skribbl.io</a>. 
    <br><br>    
    I occasionally write for <a href="hackaday.com/">Hackaday</a>, <a href="https://hackernoon.com/">Hacker Noon</a>, and <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/">Towards Data Science</a>.
