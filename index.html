    I'm <b class="t-hackcss-pop" style="color:#ff2e88;border-bottom:1px solid #ff2e88;">Sharon Lin</b>, a writer and software developer. I've hopped around a couple of places (New Jersey, Boston, London, San Francisco, Hong Kong) but I'm currently settled in Queens, NY.  
<br><br>
    This summer, I'll be interning with Microsoft. Previously, I was at <a href="https://returntocorp.com/">r2c</a>, <a href="https://meraki.cisco.com/">Cisco Meraki</a>, <a href="https://www.ll.mit.edu/">Lincoln Laboratory</a>, <a href="https://www.trailofbits.com/">Trail of Bits</a>, and <a href="https://tulip.co/">Tulip</a>.  
<br><br>
    I'm in my third year at MIT where I am studying electrical engineering & computer science and film studies. 
    <br><br>
    Aside from software, I enjoy traveling and writing. I've backpacked across Europe and Southeast Asia and worked as a <a href="https://mlh.io/">Major League Hacking</a> Coach, where I traveled to engage with student organizers at hackathons across North America.
    <br><br>    
    I write about technology for <a href="hackaday.com/">Hackaday</a>, <a href="https://hackernoon.com/">Hacker Noon</a>, and <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/">Towards Data Science</a>.
